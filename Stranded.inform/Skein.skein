You went on a fishing trip with a friend off the Malé Sea Port in the Maldive Islands. You don&apos;t remember much from what had happened but you recall the waves being really rough since there was a huge hurricane approaching that you were unaware of. You also remember crying and panicing because your friend had fell off the boat and was sucked into the deep sea in no time. You must&apos;ve passed out or something becasue you don&apos;t remmeber the rest. Luckily, you wake up on this seem-to-be abandoned island. I mean the Maldive Islands are composed with over 1,200 islands…You must be on one of those?

Stranded
An Interactive Fiction by Kaitlyn Poentis
Release 1 / Serial number 140311 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Beach
You wake up on warm sand in pain. You must&apos;ve been rolling in the reef when you got tossled around by the waves. Your face, as well as the rest of your body seems to have multiple cuts. A large piece of wood, is only a few feet away from you. You must have been floated here on that. In the distance to the east, you can see a wooden structure.

You can see an ocean, some palm trees, a piece of wood and an east ocean here.

Wooden Structure
You enter a wooden structure. I dont really know what it is, but it is definitely not trees or anything natural. There seems to be beams, along with what looks like a house foundation. The platform is about 3 feet set up above the ground and there is a brass box in the corner.

The lagoon has a slight tint of turquoise and is insanely clear. The waterfall that feeds the lagoon is probably about 100 foot long from the top of the rocks down to the pool. To the south of you is the boulders and to the west is stream that leads to a tide pool and to the east is more trees and a pond?

You can see a Cave and a jug here.

You enter a wooden structure. I dont really know what it is, but it is definitely not trees or anything natural. There seems to be beams, along with what looks like a house foundation. The platform is about 3 feet set up above the ground and there is a brass box in the corner.

You can see some dirty clothes here.
